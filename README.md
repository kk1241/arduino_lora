LoRa SX1278 Arduino, Description:
 
LoRa SX1278 Arduino Hello World & Sensor Monitoring Projectsâ€“
I have been using different types of short range and log range wireless transceiver modules for quite a long time. 
Today for the first time I am going to use these Long range and low energy LoRa SX1278 Modules with Arduino. 
This is a getting started tutorial and I will try my level best to keep things as simple as possible. 
Initially, I will start with the Hello world example. We will send the Hello world message wirelessly to the receiver LoRa module and then 
I will modify the same code for monitoring an analog sensor. I will be using a potentiometer as the sensor, 
which of course you can replace with any other sensor as per your requirement.
